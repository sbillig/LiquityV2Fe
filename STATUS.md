# Current work state

The complete Liquity V2 port goal remains active. The verified contracts below
are a partial system; production oracle integration, helpers, governance and complete multi-branch
workflows are still outstanding.

## Validated checkpoint

`./scripts/test.sh` passes **166 EVM tests and 2 Fe tests**, with 1,024 runs per
fuzz test plus cached regression inputs. Sources, scripts, tests, artifacts,
compiler and reference hashes are recorded in `tests/results/borrower-operations.json`;
the complete log is `tests/results/borrower-operations.log`.

Implemented and differentially tested:
- LiquityMath and protocol constants.
- AddressesRegistry and GasPool.
- DefaultPool, CollSurplusPool and ActivePool, including interest, batch fees,
  shutdown, transfers, permissions and rollback.
- BoldToken: ERC20, permits, EIP712 and branch/registry permissions.
- SortedTroves: individual and batch operations, hint search and exact storage.
- TroveNFT: ERC721, callbacks/reentrancy, metadata, malformed/unpadded ABI inputs.
- FixedAssetReader: SSTORE2 clipping, cap, empty/invalid pointers and packed assets.
- MetadataNFT: exact nested base64 JSON/SVG, numeric formatting, checksummed owner,
  all Bauhaus/status variants, arbitrary token strings and production assets.
- CollateralRegistry: all branches, fallback allocation, fee decay, exact rounding,
  partial redemptions and real BOLD burn/rollback; 11 differential tests include
  1,024 random sequences of 12 redemptions each.
- StabilityPool: exact P/S/B and scale accounting, pending rewards, compounding,
  stash/claim behavior, minimum remainder and rollback. Ten parity tests plus one
  system test; fuzz includes 1,024 sixteen-operation sequences and reward arithmetic.
- TroveManager: public getters, all borrower/batch hooks, liquidation, redistribution,
  regular/urgent redemption, zombie handling and shutdown. Fixed delegate modules
  preserve manager storage, caller and events; the constructor adds module addresses.
  See TROVE_MANAGER_DEPLOYMENT.md. Tests include three memory-array ABI tests,
  12 data/state tests, eight hook tests, ten flow tests and a real connected system.
- BorrowerOperations: opening, collateral/debt adjustments, repayment caps,
  closing, pending debt, delegation, batch registration/rates/migration,
  fee checks and shutdown. Twelve differential tests and two connected-system
  tests cover the full public interface, storage, logs, rollback and ABI failures.
  Fixed module deployment is documented in BORROWER_OPERATIONS_DEPLOYMENT.md.
- AddRemoveManagers: authorization, configuration, receiver selection and clearing.
- LiquityBase: registry configuration, branch totals, ratios and interest helpers.

The connected metadata test deploys actual Fe TroveNFT, MetadataNFT and
FixedAssetReader; only the manager/registry/collateral-token dependencies are mocks.
The renderer creates a stateless MetadataGeometry companion using CREATE in its
constructor, preserving the original public constructor arguments. Asset and token
calls remain in the main renderer. The companion only assembles supplied bytes.
Runtime sizes are 23,721 bytes (MetadataNFT) and 18,538 bytes (companion); main
initcode is 42,596 bytes before its 32-byte constructor argument. All size limits
are enforced. Companion deployment and output are tested directly.

PoolSystem connects real Fe pools, registry and BOLDToken. StabilityPoolSystem
also connects the actual Fe StabilityPool, exercising real interest minting,
offsets and claims. Both tests drive BO/TM-side operations and do not establish
a complete borrowing/liquidation deployment.
TroveChange, LatestTroveData and LatestBatchData ABI support are integrated.
TroveManagerSystem connects actual Fe manager modules, pools, registry, BOLDToken,
SortedTroves, TroveNFT and GasPool. It drives BO-side hooks; collateral and price
feed are controlled test contracts. BorrowerOperationsSystem uses the real Fe
BorrowerOperations and its modules with those actual Fe components. It compares
user borrowing, rate/batch changes, closing, liquidation, redemption and shutdown
against an all-Solidity branch, with collateral and price inputs controlled.

`port_status.json` retains all 102 core/helper sources; `governance_status.json`
retains all 27 governance sources. Unused generic SVG/JSON/Utils/baseSVG entry
points remain explicitly partial even though all renderer behavior is tested.

## Compiler and reference

- Solidity reference: `c8a5a4ee2e9dc024905856b6698a77d849c68c7e`.
- Latest upstream/master, rechecked with ls-remote:
  `f00132a97429f966804d70c40206ef40ebca6960`.
- Compiler integration: `ce277a26962d60fa0c5fa58ef2219313a922903b`, branch
  `liquity-v2-integration`, including existing PRs #1592, #1587 and #1585.
- All 218 HIR unit tests and 24 dedicated ABI/event execution regressions pass.
- No new compiler fixes have been authored. See COMPILER_FIXES.md.
- Fresh bootstrap verifies the exact integration tree and all pinned ancestors;
  locally generated merge commit timestamps need not be identical.
- Reference/dependency sources and five font/logo assets are hash-checked.

The renderer uses pairwise concatenation. Earlier generic tuple/array variants
were slow to compile and monolithic bytecode exceeded EIP-170. Investigation
is preserved in `tests/repros/metadata_tuple_concat.*`; PR #1585 alone is not
claimed to resolve the compile-time issue. Generated geometry/literal sources
are reproducible with `scripts/generate_bauhaus.py` and
`scripts/generate_metadata_literals.py`.

## Next work

1. Price feeds/shutdown and connection to the actual borrower operations.
2. Hints/getters, helpers and zappers.
3. Governance and full multi-branch deployment/lifecycle/invariant validation.

Preserve Solidity operation ordering, revert data and rounding. SortedTroves
reinsertion occurs before updating the manager's reported interest rate.
Native storage borrows cannot span external calls; raw handles/copies preserve
storage access ordering without weakening compiler checks. Any newly authored
compiler fix needs its own branch, regression tests and newsfragment.

BorrowerOperations preserves Solidity slots 0–12, including the packed shutdown
flag at byte 20 of slot 9. Runtime sizes: main 13,892 bytes, opening 12,052,
adjustments 22,580, batches 23,828. Its constructor takes the registry and three
fixed module addresses. The registry WETH getter uses CALL as declared by the
Solidity interface; a stateful constructor mock checks this behavior.

The next price-feed draft is isolated in `/tmp/liquity-feed-project` with twelve
passing differential tests in `/tmp/liquity-feed-inspect-project`. It is not yet
part of the validated repository checkpoint.
